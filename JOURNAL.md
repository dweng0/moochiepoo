## Day 12 — 10:15 — Implement user context input (genuine scenario, false coverage positive)

The "add user context to hint request" scenario was marked covered in BDD_STATUS.md due to partial word matching on "context" in unrelated tests. No actual implementation existed.

- Added `renderContextInput(container, onChange)` to `popup-ui.ts` — collapsible panel with a textarea below the hint button
- Extended `buildPrompt` with optional `userContext` param; appended as "Additional context from the user" when provided
- Extended `HintRequest` interface with optional `userContext`
- `background.ts` reads `userContext` from storage and passes it to `requestHint`
- `popup.ts` renders the context input and saves its value to storage on each keystroke
- 7 new tests, 171 total, 41/41 scenarios genuinely covered

## Day 12 — 10:00 — Implement copy code button and regenerate hint

Two uncovered BDD scenarios found and implemented this session.

**Scenario: copy code from a code panel**
- Modified `markdownToHtml` in `popup-ui.ts` to wrap code blocks in a `div.code-panel` with a `.copy-btn` button carrying `data-code` attribute
- Added `attachCopyHandlers(container)` export that attaches clipboard write on click, adds `copied` class, and removes it after 2 seconds
- 6 tests added, all passing

**Scenario: Get Hint button changes to Regenerate after first hint**
- Modified `createGetHintButton` in `popup-button.ts` to check `hintHistory` on init and set label to "Regenerate" if history exists
- Also updates label to "Regenerate" when a hint arrives via `onChanged` listener
- 4 tests added, all passing

**Result:** 41/41 scenarios covered, 164 tests passing, build green. Committed as fc1ea54.

## Day 11 — 00:31 — Update day count

Updated the day count in the project files to reflect Day 11. This was a maintenance task to ensure proper tracking of development progress. No new functionality was implemented today. Next: review current state and assess if any scenarios need attention.
